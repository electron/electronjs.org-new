ElectronJS will pause for the month of December 2021, but will return to full speed in January 2022.

---

## What will be the same in December

1. Zero-day and other major security-related releases will be published as necessary.
1. Code of Conduct reports and moderation will continue.

## What will be different in December

1. No new Betas or Stable releases in December. No nightly releases for the last two weeks of December.
1. With few exceptions, no pull-request reviews or merges.
1. No issue tracker updates on any repositories. (Security incidents should follow the guide at https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/master/SECURITY.md)
1. No Discord debugging help from maintainers.
1. No social media content updates.

## Why is this happening?

In short, while maintainers are happy and engaged with the project, THE WORLD IS TIRED. 
December is a quiet month for most companies, so we want to give our maintainers a chance to recharge. We encourage other projects to consider similar measures.

## Should I be worried about the future of Electron?

No. We are able to take this step because the project is in good shape.
Everyone is looking forward to 2022, and we expect good things to come!
