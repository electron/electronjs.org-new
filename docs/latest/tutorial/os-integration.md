title: 'Integrating with the OS'
description: 'This guide will step you through the process of creating a barebones Hello World app in Electron, similar to electron/electron-quick-start.'

There are many ways to integrate with the Operating System. In some cases it could be platform specific
(like Apple's TouchBar), in others it could be through APIs to have a more integrated look and feel
(like modifying the Title Bar), or using APIs that give you access to USB and Bluetooth devices.

The following is a list of all the guides currently available.
Each guide contains a practical example in a minimal, self-contained example app.
The easiest way to run these examples is by downloading [Electron Fiddle][fiddle].

Once Fiddle is installed, you can press on the "Open in Fiddle" button that you
will find below code samples like the following one:

```fiddle docs/latest/fiddles/quick-start
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const replaceText = (selector, text) => {
    const element = document.getElementById(selector)
    if (element) element.innerText = text
  }

  for (const type of ['chrome', 'node', 'electron']) {
    replaceText(`${type}-version`, process.versions[type])
  }
})
```

If there is still something that you do not know how to do, please take a look at the [API][app]
as there is a chance it might be documented just there (and also open an issue requesting the
guide!).
