# Swizzled `src/theme` Components

The contents of this folder are custom Docusaurus React components generated
from the `yarn swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic <component-name>` command.

Note that Docusaurus discourages the use of this command during the beta phase
due to API instability, so please keep swizzling to a minimum.

> We discourage swizzling of components during the Docusaurus 2 beta phase.
> The theme components APIs are likely to evolve and have breaking changes.
> If possible, stick with the default appearance for now.

For more reading, see the [Themes](https://docusaurus.io/docs/using-themes)
guide in the Docusaurus documentation.
